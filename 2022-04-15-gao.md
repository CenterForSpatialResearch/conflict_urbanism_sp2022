## Abstract  

Once a country reinforcing its homogeneity, now, for the past 30 years, South Korea's highest mode of migration has been by marriage. Mostly women from southeast Asian countries, namely China, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Cambodia, their unions encouraged by government-sponsored subsidies. This '**marriage migration**' was driven by the considerable numbers of bachelors in rural towns, resulting from fast economic growth and internal migrations. At the same time, these migrants have created economic and cultural links between Korea and their home countries. A cultural and social phenomenon(Onishi 2008), this movement has vast implications and impacts on the future of this country and on what it means to be identified as "Korean."  

This project investigates these international and domestic scale movements that reveals a spatial complexity created by marital cultures, local policies, and ultimately driven by economical needs.    ADD A DEFINING SENTENCE

Since the Korean War, South Korea has been experiencing a tremendous and steady economic rise, now ranked the 10th economy in 2022. Its drastic increase in national GDP from the 80s was coined the "miracle on the Han River." Along with the economic rise, a mass country-wide migration from rural to urban areas has been ongoing. As a result, more than 50 percent of the national population lives in the Seoul metropolitan area, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of the country's land area. Akin to the traditional family practices, more men remained in rural areas than women, contributing to the decline in birth rate that has been persistent in Korea since the 60s. Consequently, this gender imbalance in rural South Korea caused a sharp drop in population in rural towns. As a part of the revitalization program of those rural municipalities, local governments started to provide subsidies for '**marriage migration**,' giving rise to foreign brides starting from the 90s.

## International Marriage Migration to South Korea

Starting from the 1990s, 35 rural municipal governments started subsidizing private marriage brokers to introduce bachelor farmers to ethnically Korean women in China and other foreign nationals, paying the brokers 4 to 10 million won (back then around $3,800 to $12,000) per marriage. These policies were established in an attempt to address the aging population by encouraging these bachelors to find a wife and eventually produce children, raising the population growth. It was not until 30 years in practice, in 2021, these government subsidies started to be removed. Such marriages increased almost fivefold in South Korea between 2000 and 2005, from 6,945 to 30,719 (Korea National Statistical Office 2011a). Now bolstered at more than 334,000, these marriage migrants (immigrants and naturalized by marriage) account for 16.7 percent of all immigrants. Established as a monoethnic country, Korea, now demographically and politically, is turning towards becoming a multi-ethnical society.

However, these political movements and economic subsidies supporting **marriage migration** have resulted in an adverse effect. Marriage migrants have reported facing higher levels of domestic and social conflict; while isolated from their home countries and remain disadvantaged in the new environment. Furthermore, they tend to face more economic difficulties since more men from rural lower-income brackets sought help from marriage agencies for foreign brides. A study conducted by Ewha Womans University in 2022 has found that “...immigrant women in husband-decision households were more likely to have depressive mood … poorer life satisfaction … and poorer marital satisfaction … than women in joint-decision households.” (PLOS ONE 2022)

Marriage migrants have also been expected to maintain the patriarchal hierarchy by acting as compliant and submissive wives, limiting their career growth and eventual integration into Korean society. Language barriers, cultural differences, and financial dependencies contribute to the characteristic isolation these new immigrants face in the homogenous society they arrived in. ‘...marriage migrants play multiple roles - as mothers, domestic workers, caretakers, or family helpers.” (Piper and Roces 2003)

## The Story of Pham, from Vietnam to Cheongsong County  

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/Cheongsong_marriage_migrant_by_sex.png)

Cheongsong County, a county in Gyungsang-buk Province has an influx of marriage migrants, which make up more than 69 percent (160 of 231) of its foreign residents in the municipality. Among them, the overwhelming proportion are women. Additionally, Cheongsong County was one of the counties that sponsored the most significant subsidies (up to 10,000 dollars per case) for international marriage as a part of rural revitalization policies. 

We are translating the architectural space inhabited by a marriage migrant from Vietnam. Pham, through the images from the documentary “Tales of Multicultural Inlaws”. By reconstructing the typical rural house she lives in Cheongsong, we are turning this narrative into a more intimate level. Her hierarchy in the household becomes immersive to the viewers- her limited access to the rest of the house and her movement around her living quarters clearly shows her unequal position in the family.

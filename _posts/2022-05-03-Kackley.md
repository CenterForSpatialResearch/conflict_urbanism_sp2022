The Chacma baboons that have been invading the streets of Cape Town, South Africa. As Cape Town expanded and habitat began to gradually diminish around its perimeter, the resident chacma baboon troops began to move into the city in search of food.

Once there, they were enticed by anthropogenic food sources that were calorie rich and easy to attain, and decided to stay This led them into conflict with humans, as an abundance of readily available food and less natural predators led to the baboons becoming increasingly aggressive as they searched for food.

Attempts to dissuade the baboons, such as guards armed with paintball guns posing as rival troops, proved futile. The baboon’s endangered status made managing them increasingly difficult as little else could be done besides trying to harmlessly discourage them.

Today, there are about 16-17 baboon troops that roam the South African Peninsula. [11 troops of baboons](https://www.baboons.org.za/index.php/management/cape-peninsula/rangers) are actively managed by baboon rangers. These 11-troops actively patrol Cape Town, stealing from garbage cans, cars, and even homes in order to find food. To manage and live with these animals, we must reconsider how we understand them. To do this the typical range map must be extrapolated and challenged, being rebuilt along ideas of animal behavior and a layer of human interaction unique to the urban ecosystem.

To form the basis for our critique, we examined the Chicago Urban Coyote project and its efforts to create range maps by geotagging various coyotes in the city of Chicago. The maps revealed several unique points of the coyotes foraging behavior in an urban ecosystem, such as smaller territories, more sporadic movement, and more overlap in ranges. However, they did not, and could not, account for the added layer of human interaction only an urban animal would encounter.

Take, for example, the infamous incident of the coyote in the Quizno’s coke cooler. The coyote, searching for a place to cool itself on a hot summer day, entered a Quizno’s in downtown Chicago and promptly climbed into the coke cooler. While the range map shows where this coyote may be in the plan view of the neighborhood, it fails to capture the intimate realities of cohabitation between people and wildlife that occur at the architectural and personal scale.  

This proves especially limiting when studying Cape Town’s urban baboons, whose confrontational nature, as well as frequent use of homes and other buildings as foraging habitat, demands study in:
1. 3 - Dimensions
2. A more intimate scale  

To better understand these animals and facilitate a more peaceful co-living arrangement, we propose a methodology that utilizes behavioral algorithms to predict their movements at a more intimate, and 3-dimensional, scale. Compiled alongside found videos, images, and experiential diagrams, the baboon moves from the abstract of the 2d-range map to a fleshed-out, living creature whose complex decision making and behavior can be better understood.  

####  Predictive Map + 3D Simulation

To produce our predictive range map of the baboons, we began by identifying their primary anthropogenic food source: garbage. Using Cape Town’s open data, we were able to then identify which neighborhoods had the highest abundance of garbage through presence of landfills, illegal dumping, and tourist activity. Neighborhoods were then ranked based on the abundance of garbage, which, in turn, would become a baboon attractor. The patch selection model was then used to create a predictive model of where baboons were likely to go by neighborhood at the city scale. The model typically works as (abundance of food) times (chance of predation) times (net energy gained), with chance of predation decreasing and net energy gained increasing as abundance of food increases. Here, we used abundance of garbage as a proxy for abundance of food, finding that baboons would likely select neighborhoods in proximity to landfills, tourist traps, and public amenities, such as parks, near either.

Finally, we create a topographic model of Capetown, which holds animations of the baboons' pathways along the landscape as well as other agents, such as cars and buses.

####  The Human Experience  

We continue to explore the experience of living with an urban baboon wildlife by zooming into the architectural scale. We researched video footage to understand how the baboons were inhabiting and moving across the landscape at the architectural scale.  

![Analysis of baboon movement](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/BABOON_Movement.gif)
Data: ""  

We found that roofs and lawns were frequently used for quick entrances and exits when raiding homes, garbage cans, and cars, especially when confronted by people or dogs. Using the wealth of video sources that circulate online, we then proceed to categorize where humans come into contact with baboons. Using the 24/7 baboon hotline, we have identified typical urban spaces where those happen and scenarios of how they happen.  
Our five urban categories are:
1. In an Urban Area

According to the [Roo Els Conservatory](https://rooiels.weebly.com/tips-for-building-and-plot-clearingg.html), here are some tips for Baboon-proofing your home. See more information on [Baboon Page](http://rooiels.weebly.com/baboons.html).  

###  Insert interactive image

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

The government of Mumbai has envisioned the status of “world-class city” for the Indian metropolis. In pursuing this status, the speculative practices of financialization, regional politics, and the desire for easy profits have too often triumphed over the creation of a just and equitable city. The result is the prevalence of the economically dominant classes over the needs of the city’s more vulnerable, largely inter-state migrant population. Dharavi, the largest informal settlement in Asia, lies at the center of this conflict. Once a former wetland, Dharavi is now experiencing skyrocketing real estate values due to its optimal location adjacent to Mumbai’s key financial and transit corridors. The area has endured decades of tension as the government’s measures to upgrade living conditions in Dharavi repeatedly prioritize claiming a world-class heritage over uplifting the residents’ socio-economic conditions.

This tension can be viewed forensically through the lens of the few executed, and the many failed, slum redevelopment projects devised by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). Despite their receipt of significant investments, these projects are often ultimately casualties in Mumbai’s political war. Our research project deconstructs the consequences of Mumbai’s political life on a temporal scale, those which lurk below the deceptive surface of “politics as usual” to hinder the social and environmental equity owed to the people of Dharavi.

Dharavi is located on the northernmost tip of the Island City of Mumbai, which connects South Mumbai to the northern suburbs. It is the only suburb of Mumbai that connects to four local railway stations: Bandra, Mahim, Matunga, and Sion. Domestic and international airports are located 3 and 4 kilometers, respectively, from Dharavi. A local transport depot is located in Dharavi for those who travel by bus. This proximity to key transportation nodes means that Dharavi is located virtually in the heart of Greater Mumbai. Its closeness to Mumbai’s business district, railways, and airport provide the strategic advantage of leveraging Dharavi improvement costs with high sale buildable areas.

In pursuing the goal of becoming a “world-class city,” Mumbai has struggled to protect the rights and needs of its more vulnerable citizens from the growth machine and rent seeking behaviors of its wealthier and more powerful populations. As infrastructure, Mumbai’s slum rehabilitation buildings are manifestations of the broken contract between the state and its most vulnerable citizens.

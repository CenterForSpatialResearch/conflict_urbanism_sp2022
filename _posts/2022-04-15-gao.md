title:  "Redefining Homogeneity: Marriage Migration in Rural South Korea"
author: "Yani Gao, Hyuein Song, Myungju Ko"

Once a country reinforcing its homogeneity, now, for the past 30 years, South Korea's highest mode of migration has been by marriage. Primarily women from southeast Asian countries, namely China, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Cambodia, their unions are encouraged by government-sponsored subsidies. This '**marriage migration**' was driven by the considerable numbers of bachelors in rural towns, resulting from fast economic growth and internal migrations. At the same time, these migrants have created economic and cultural links between Korea and their home countries. A cultural and social phenomenon(Onishi 2008), this movement has vast implications and impacts on the future of this country and on what it means to be identified as "Korean."

This project investigates these international and domestic scale movements that reveal a spatial complexity created by marital cultures and local policies and ultimately driven by economic needs. 

#### **Domestic Migration in South Korea: 1970s and Onward**

Since the Korean War, South Korea has been experiencing a tremendous and steady economic rise, now ranked the 10th economy in 2022. Its drastic increase in national GDP from the 80s was coined the "miracle on the Han River." Along with the economic rise, a mass country-wide migration from rural to urban areas has been ongoing. As a result, more than 50 percent of the national population lives in the Seoul metropolitan area, which accounts for only 0.6 percent of the country's land area.

Along with these recent economic changes and mass migration, South Korean social life remains embedded in Confucian culture, especially in rural areas, where the emphasis is placed on family and kinship. The patrilineal Confucian notion of the family has an immense impact on this domestic migration across Korea. Confucianism underscores that filial piety is a cardinal virtue and that marriage and procreation are the first son's most important social obligations. (Hsu 61) 

A traditional Korean nuclear family, according to Confucianism values, has four formal criteria: 
  1. The corporate family 가 (家).
  2. The family's formal head Hoju 호주 (戶主), the oldest man in the family, holds significant rights and privileges.
  3. The successor to the house headship 호주계승 (戶主繼承), which is the eldest son.
  4. The estate is considered family property 가산 (家産).

This nuclear family is completely patrilineally conducted, where the prominent family is the direct line of descendants 친족 (親族), and other relatives through female links are considered outside family 외갓집 (外家). Therefore, when a daughter marries, she will be immediately called "an outsider," leaving the corporate family. In other words, she joins her husband's family and is responsible for her domestic duties, including serving him and his parents, thereby maintaining traditional family customs and reputations.

Akin to the traditional family practices, more men remained in rural areas than women, contributing to the decline in birth rate that has been persistent in Korea since the 60s. Consequently, this gender imbalance in rural South Korea caused a sharp drop in population in rural towns. Moreover, as a part of the revitalization program of those rural municipalities, local governments started to provide subsidies for '**marriage migration**,' giving rise to foreign brides starting from the 90s.

#### **International Marriage Migration to South Korea**

Starting from the 1990s, 35 rural municipal governments started subsidizing private marriage brokers to introduce bachelor farmers to ethnically Korean women in China and other foreign nationals, paying the brokers 4 to 10 million won (back then around $3,800 to $12,000) per marriage. 

![Percentage of women graph](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/Woman_Marriage_Migrant.png)

These policies were established in an attempt to address the aging population by encouraging these bachelors to find a wife and eventually produce children, raising the population growth. It was not until 30 years in practice, in 2021, that these government subsidies started to be removed. As a result, such marriages increased almost fivefold in South Korea between 2000 and 2005, from 6,945 to 30,719 (Korea National Statistical Office 2011a). Now bolstered at more than 334,000, these marriage migrants (immigrants and naturalized by marriage) account for 16.7 percent of all immigrants. Established as a monoethnic country, Korea, now demographically and politically, is turning towards becoming a multi-ethnical society.

However, these political movements and economic subsidies supporting **marriage migration** have resulted in an adverse effect. Marriage migrants have reported facing higher levels of domestic and social conflict; while isolated from their home countries and remain disadvantaged in the new environment. Furthermore, they tend to face more economic difficulties since more men from rural lower-income brackets seek help from marriage agencies for foreign brides. A study conducted by Ewha Womans University in 2022 has found that "...immigrant women in husband-decision households were more likely to have depressive mood ... poorer life satisfaction ... and poorer marital satisfaction ... than women in joint-decision households." (PLOS ONE 2022)

Marriage migrants have also been expected to maintain the patriarchal hierarchy by acting as compliant and submissive wives, limiting their career growth and eventual integration into Korean society. Language barriers, cultural differences, and financial dependencies contribute to the characteristic isolation these new immigrants face in the homogenous society they arrived in: '...marriage migrants play multiple roles - as mothers, domestic workers, caretakers, or family helpers." (Piper and Roces 2003)

#### **The Story of Pham, from Vietnam to Cheongsong County**  

![cheongsong case](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/Cheongsong_marriage_migrant_by_sex.png)

Cheongsong County, a county in Gyungsang-buk Province, has an influx of marriage migrants, which make up more than 69 percent (160 of 231) of its foreign residents in the municipality. Among them, the overwhelming proportion is women. Additionally, Cheongsong County, a rural area of the province, was one of the counties that sponsored the most significant subsidies (up to 10,000 dollars per case) for international marriage as a part of rural revitalization policies.  

We are translating the architectural space inhabited by a marriage migrant from Vietnam, Pham, through the images from the documentary "Tales of Multicultural Inlaws." By reconstructing the typical rural house she lives in Cheongsong, we turn this narrative into a more intimate level. Her hierarchy in the household becomes immersive to the viewers- her limited access to the rest of the house and her movement around her living quarters, including the kitchen, living room and kids' room, clearly shows her unequal position and traditional feminine role in the family.

Yet, more and more individuals have broken this stereotype and surfaced in Korean society. In addition, multicultural support centers in communities help integrate new immigrants. Policies such as the "Female Marriage Migrant Family Social Integration and Support Policy" and the "Foreigners in Korea Fundamental Treatment Law" help ensure a successful entrance into Korean society.

#### **Conclusion**  

The research unfolded the homogeneity of South Korea through the lenses of marriage migrants on various scales, from the global to the intimate. The story visualizes how urbanization in one country expands its impact over the boundaries between countries and permeates one's everyday life. Combined with the Confucian culture, which is deeply rooted in rural areas, urbanization of South Korea has accompanied an unbalanced gender ratio in the rural towns in addition to the common issues entailed by urbanization, such as population decrease and underdevelopment. Female marriage migrants from neighboring countries have been filling up the voids created by urbanization. This phenomenon has caused adverse effects, revealing how South Korea's homogeneity, a distinct characteristic of the county, has changed. 

This research is conducted from the perspective of Korean society, which mainly investigates through the data visualization of population movements. However, if conducted through a political and economy-driven approach, this phenomenon would reveal much more conflict on the scale of international affairs. Therefore, a probable different approach would be to trace back these marriage migrants to their home country by collecting data on their remittance, and investigating how this money drives the supply of potential migrants. Similar cases are happening in developed regions of North America, Western Europe, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and New Zealand, where a further investigation could expand.

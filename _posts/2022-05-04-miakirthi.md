### Introduction  

<p><span>Today, cities across the world are developing under an unprecedented scale and sophistication of digital tools, becoming rapidly  and seamlessly integrated within our urban infrastructures. Invisible systems of digital interconnectedness track and analyze vast amounts of information about people—supposedly to apply data-informed solutions to urban issues. Law enforcement agencies increasingly adopt surveillance technologies as a tactic to reduce crime and increase security in our communities; however, the indiscriminate use of street-level, military-grade surveillance technologies have begun to blur the lines between security and oppression in our public spaces. &nbsp;</i></span></p>
<p><span>Normal people going about ordinary life in the city are being implicated in a massive data extraction operation at every stoplight, intersection, subway station—disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. <i>This project investigates the US law enforcement’s use of public urban space as a covert tool for a massive data extraction operation, and how it conflicts with privacy in modern urban life.</i> &nbsp;</i></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Surveillance Technology Distribution & Data Flows 
<p><span> A vast majority of the nation’s surveillance technology is deployed by city police department agencies and sheriffs offices, compared to other law enforcement agencies. This city-level deployment of surveillance technology implicates cities across the US as the primary scope and jurisdiction at which data extraction occurs. The geographic boundary of the city is being used to facilitate and serve the police state
</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The deployment of police surveillance has hierarchical jurisdiction and data flows. The local level data collected by city police departments flow upwards into state and federal law enforcement agencies’ intelligence systems. At the top of the hierarchy is the federal homeland security intelligence offices that have access to a vast and robust system of intelligence analysis, informed by data collected by cities and states across the nation. 
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><span>Surveillance technologies can be broken down into two main categories, data extraction tools and data analytical tools. Data extraction tools are surveillance devices deployed into public spaces to collect data from its environment. Data analytical tools are software that analyze and predict trends based on the data collected by the data extraction tools.  
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Information collected by data extraction tools flow into many different types of data analysis softwares that overlap and interlock to create a powerful security network operation. The data alone is not necessarily where the most dangerous consequences lie— it is when the data is input into a series of sophisticated analytical software software, at which the data becomes significantly more dangerous. Data analysis and predictions made by law enforcement. These analysis softwares are often equipped with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies which essentially teach computers how to understand what data means, and predict what trends and behaviors will occur in the future.  Facial recognition, predictive policing, and other analytics reinforce racial bias when they “learn” from historic crime-related datasets —which are fraught with discriminatory practices. Trevor Paglen, an American artist known for his work in digital surveillance, described racism in AI as “not a bug, but a feature,” in an interview. Machines learn from humans— and human history is inextricable from racism and abuse. Feeding these data as input into a computer language will teach the computer to speak that racist language. 
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>When looking at the top types of technologies used by agencies across the US, large urban areas at the periphery of the country more commonly deploy analytical tools, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Florida, Atlanta, and Chicago.

### Private Technology Vendors: Domestic And International Firms:  

<p><span>US law enforcement surveillance technologies operate in an immense network of public-private partnerships—government agencies deploy the surveillance technologies across the nation, and private technology firms manufacture them. The power held in surveillance systems is largely related to who owns and accesses the data; private firms in the US that manufacture law enforcements’ technologies can use the generated civic data generated for their own interests. 
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><iframe src="/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/surv - US vendor map.html" style="border-width: 0px;left: 50%;right: 50%;

<p><span>Connecting the types of US agencies’ surveillance technologies, the vendor for each technology, and the origin or headquarters of each vendor showed the murky supply chains behind. Vendors had both domestic and international origins.  
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>A large majority of US-made surveillance technology is manufactured in Santa Monica, California. This is because Ring, Amazon’s home surveillance camera system, has partnerships with about 1,332  different law enforcement agencies, comprising a large proportion of domestic-based surveillance technology. Ring is Amazon's smart home security system, where users install Ring surveillance cameras at their front doors and may choose to partake in Neighbors, Ring’s social media app. The app, known as the“new neighborhood watch,” allows neighbors to report “suspicious activities” within a certain radius of their home’s location. Ring’s local security communities and its many police partnerships form a network of neighborhood surveillance<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Amazon has been criticized for collecting an enormous amount of data from Ring users, not disclosing the full details of its partnership with law enforcement, and for reinforcing the racial biases of the communities that use it.  
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>“Ring sells a very particular message: while you shouldn’t trust your neighbors, you can trust Amazon to help police it.”<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>Though individual homes’ front doorsteps are not public space, the combined footage from different users throughout a neighborhood creates hyperlocal, intimate surveillance networks, accessible to police departments. Police departments did not previously have such small-scale surveillance access of neighborhoods, front lawns, and neighbors’ behavioral interactions. Smaller community-scale public spaces are now being privatized through smart home surveillance technology and sold to public agencies. Amazon’s combined database from its expansive e-commerce distribution network and its Ring-Neighbors surveillance network  creates a massive dataset, highly tied to locational city data.  
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>When looking at international vendors of US surveillance technology, China stands out as the most prominent vendor—almost entirely due to DJI drone manufacturing. Internationally manufactured, US-deployed surveillance technologies have significant data privacy implications because most countries have different data privacy policies. In China, every technology company is legally required to turn in any collected data to the Chinese government. </span></p>

<p><span>DJI, the Chinese tech company responsible for manufacturing a majority of the US law enforcement agencies’ drones, was recently added to the US Department of Treasury’s investment blacklist after discovery of DJI’s role in the surveillance of the Uyghur Muslim population in the Xinjiang Region’s concentration camps<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Cyber security researchers have since found the data collected from DJI aligns with Chinese government surveillance practices, which require drones to be linked to a user’s identity,” giving the government access to images, videos, biometric data, location data, and all other data generated by drones<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>. The US federal government has largely stopped using drones manufactured by Chinese companies, although state and local-level enforcement continues to deploy them.</span></p>

<p><span>When Chinese drones fly over public spaces in the US—like the 2020 incident in Minneapolis during which a homeland security drone flew over a George Floyd protest—it is unclear if Americans’ data is being extracted and sent to the vendor’s homeland databases. Many are suspicious that the Chinese government has full access to Americans’ data but these claims are hard to confirm, as technology firms go to great lengths to keep their information about their data flows, uses, and applications private.</span></p>

### Implications of International Firms and Data:
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Drones and China</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drone-generated data also enables national security threats. DJI, the Chinese tech company responsible for manufacturing a majority of the US law enforcement agencies&rsquo; drones, was recently added to the US Department of Treasury&rsquo;s investment blacklist after information was uncovered regarding DJI&rsquo;s role in surveilling the Uyghur Muslim population in the Xinjiang Region&rsquo;s concentration camps. Cyber security researchers have since found the data collected from DJI aligns with Chinese government surveillance practices, which require drones to be linked to a user&rsquo;s identity,&rdquo; giving the Chinese government access to images, videos, biometric data, location data, and all other data generated by drones. The US federal government has largely stopped using drones manufactured by Chinese companies, although state and local-level enforcement continues to deploy them. DJI&rsquo;s case reflects the increasing security risk of international data leaks resulting from the surveillance technology sector in the US&mdash;even if a technology gets banned, the data already generated from them persists, likely in intelligence offices abroad that closely monitor the data</span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Facial Recognition and France</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We found IDEMIA, to be the top outsourced facial recognition software vendor for US law enforcement. IDEMIA is a french identity- verification security services company that collects highly sensitive personally identifiable information such as drivers licenses, passports, and biometric data. However, in 2021, a former top IDEMIA executive, Charles Carroll, filed a lawsuit against IDEMIA, claiming that the company exposed millions of Americans&rsquo; personally identifiable information by allowing foreign software developers to use the data to create certain apps that are used by US citizens. Carroll claimed that the software&rsquo;s security had been compromised when the company agreed to exploit data for potential profits.</span></p>

  position: relative;" scrolling="no"></iframe>
### Regulations  
<p><span>At the current status quo, federal policy lacks a framework to regulate how governmental agencies may use surveillance technologies and data. Although aerial surveillance is almost ubiquitously used by law enforcement across the nation, Officials do not need to obtain search warrants when it comes to many surveillance operations such as flying drones over civilians.</span></p>
<p><span>Stored Communications Act of 1986: federal law that prohibits an &ldquo;electronic communications service provider&rdquo; from &ldquo;sharing users communication and account records, subject to a list of exceptions.&rdquo; There's an exception for law enforcement, but none for defendants. Police can protect themselves, but individuals cant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Proposed Legislation</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Restricting drone usage by law enforcement is an important first step toward regulating data and privacy from drones.&nbsp;In 2021, Senator Jessica Ramos and Representative Ron Kim proposed a Senate Bill S675 and Assembly Bill A3311 to establish the &ldquo;protect our privacy (POP) act.&rdquo;&nbsp;The bill proposes that law enforcement officials be federally required to obtain a warrant before deploying a drone to surveil any protest, demonstration, or investigation, and that drone footage is not linked to facial recognition software.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Legislators and technologists must also consider increasing the transparency of the process by which local police departments acquire drones. In NYC, the NYPD can currently utilize an appropriations loophole to pay for an unlimited number of drones using federal grants and private donations without any prior local oversight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
### In the news  
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Clearview Facial Recognition Software</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Clearview is a facial recognition firm widely used by police departments around the nation, including NYPD and police departments in California and Texas. Clearview claims to be the &ldquo;worlds&rsquo; largest facial network&rdquo; trusted by law enforcement, but non-consensually collects billions of images of faces from online accounts such as Venmo, Facebook, and Youtube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Derrick Ingram & Facial Recognition, Minneapolis, 2020</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In August 2020, the NYPD used facial recognition to track down a Black Lives Matter protestor, Derrick Ingram. Ingram was a leader in NYC&rsquo;s BLM demonstrations and did much of the digital organizing and educated protestors on the risks of cell phone taps and social media monitoring. Police used a photo from Ingrams Instagram page to match his identity, and later showed up outside of his apartment with drones hovering over his roof, urging Ingram to voluntarily surrender.&nbsp;the NYPD has used facial recognition in at least 22,000 cases since 2017</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>BLM Protests & Drones, Minneapolis, 2020</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Many believe that the data generated and monitored as a result of drone surveillance poses significant privacy threats to citizens as well as security threats to the nation. During the 2020 George Floyd protests in Minneapolis, US Customs and Border Protection quietly flew a drone over protestors, raising concerns about civic data privacy.&nbsp;Though the drones allegedly did not collect facial recognition or other personally-identifiable data from protestors, an investigation from MIT Technology Review uncovered evidence that law enforcement in Minneapolis built a sophisticated real-time data-sharing system that exchanged information about protestors with SWAT and command centers. Thousands of protestors, most of whom were not engaged in illegal activities, were subject to their sensitive data being mass-extracted from them without search warrants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
### Control surveillance&mdash; not no surveillance  
<p><span>Though surveillance technologies and data extraction can be extremely dangerous, it would be an oversight not to address their positive impacts and capacity to improve city life and safety. Surveillance cameras can keep an eye out for crime in public spaces and hold those involved accountable. In criminal investigations, video footage serves as extremely valuable&nbsp; evidence that helps build and strengthen cases. Data collected and analysis about our cities can help inform service improvements and make systems and processes much more time, money, and energy efficient.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Surveillance technologies can be effectively utilized to serve the public good. We are not saying no surveillance, we are saying control surveillance. When George Floyd was being killed, the police officer was being surveilled by Darnella Frazier, the woman who video recorded the officer. When there is an abuse of power, surveillance technologies also have the capacity to hold abusers accountable.</span></p>

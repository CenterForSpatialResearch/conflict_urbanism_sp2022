<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiloe is a mix of rolling green hills and blue waters on the eastern side and a rocky coastline pounded by the mighty Pacific Ocean to the west. This island has pristine landscapes, including winding rivers, lakes, and lagoons with a fascinating array of flora and fauna. The unique landscape shapes the culture of local communities known as Chilotes. The island is the second-largest in South America, cut off from the mainland by the Chacao Canal</span></p>

#### From Readings: Planning vs. Zoning

<ul>
    <li>&ldquo; &lsquo;Planning&rsquo; and &lsquo;Zoning&rsquo; are closely related, for, in a general way, planning embraces zoning and zoning may not entirely exclude planning&rdquo; - The Supreme Court of Kentucky</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Planning is long range; zoning is immediate. Planning is general; zoning is specific. Planning involves political processes; zoning is a legislative function and an exercise of the police power. Planning is generally dynamic while zoning is more or less static. Planning often involves frequent changes; zoning designations should not. Planning has a speculative impact upon property values, while zoning may actually constitute a valuable property right.&rdquo; - Idaho Supreme Court</li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Planning</span>
        <ul>
            <li>&ldquo;City or town planning is a constitutional concept. ... Municipal planning, in a word, is the accommodation, through unity in construction, of the variant interests seeking expression in the local physical life to the interest of the community as a social unit. Planning is a science and art concerned with land economics and land policies in terms of social and economic betterment.&rdquo; - A NJ Court<br />Zoning</li>
            <li>&ldquo;a legislative act representing a legislative judgment as to how the land within the City should be utilized and where the lines of demarcation between the several use zones should be drawn.&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>

#### Introduction

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the second half of the last century, the world has experienced rapid urbanization processes, which increased the percentage of the global urban population from 30% in 1957 to over 50% in 2018 (United Nations, 2019). Projections suggest that urbanization will especially accelerate in major regions of the developing world over the coming decades, leading to a substantial demographic transformation process that will concentrate fully two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s population in cities and towns (UN Habitat, 2020).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following research strives to understand the past, present, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> future urbanization patterns of rural areas in the island of Chiloe and the City of Bengaluru located in the south of Chile and the south of India</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, respectively. The objective of the study will be focused on understanding the structures that promote urbanization and the conflicts established by the urban-rural dichotomy. By analyzing the patterns and policies of urbanization in Chiloe, Chile and Bangalore, India - we illustrate factors causing urbanization and speculate its impact in the future. We visualize patterns of urbanization and analyze the parameters that have shaped this process, while speculating future growth and impact on the rural and its ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the study, parameters such as property, demographics and regulations will be established to study the urbanization pattern. The impact on the rural population due to urbanization will be illustrated through mapping and analyzing policy frameworks.</span></p>

#### Chiloe Study Case 

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Context &amp; Geography&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The province of Chilo&eacute; is formed by the Chilo&eacute; Archipelago, located in the south of Chile with an area of 9181 km2 . It is one of the main tourist attractions in the country, well known for its churches, traditions, and unique landscapes. The province has a population of 168,185 inhabitants, who are concentrated in the three most populous cities: Ancud, Castro and Quell&oacute;n. Chilo&eacute; has been described by Renato C&aacute;rdenas, historian at the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioteca_Nacional_de_Chile"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chilean National Library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span></i><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">a distinct enclave, linked more to the sea than the continent, a fragile society with a strong sense of solidarity and a deep territorial attachment.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiloe is a mix of rolling green hills and blue waters on the eastern side and a rocky coastline pounded by the mighty Pacific Ocean to the west. This island has pristine landscapes, including winding rivers, lakes, and lagoons with a fascinating array of flora and fauna. The unique landscape shapes the culture of local communities known as Chilotes. The island is the second-largest in South America, cut off from the mainland by the Chacao Canal</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Puente Chacao</span></p>
<p>After years of public debate, the fixed connection between "Isla Grande de Chilo&eacute;" and the Chilean mainland will be established. The Chacao Bridge is estimated to be ready by 2025, and it will be a hanging structure with a length of 2,750 meters, which will link the continent with the island over the Chacao Channel. The bridge will reduce the journey to just 3 minutes and create better accessibility for its inhabitants and visitors.</p>
<p><strong>There has been a controversial discussion about the bridge and its future. It can be argued that without sustainable planning and adequate legislation, the island will be negatively affected by the proliferation of development projects that do not consider the island's natural landscape and cultural traditions.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land Subdivision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its early stage urbanization process Chiloe is facing a rapid proliferation of land subdivisions with clear residential purposes in rural areas near the coast, lakes, national parks, and riverbanks. The origin of this problem lies in Decree Law No. 3,516 of 1980, which established the rules on the subdivision of agricultural, livestock or forestry rural land of no less than 5,000 m {+2} in the so-called "pleasant plots", and that prohibited changing their agricultural use to the lots resulting from the subdivision.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;These communes have an agricultural vocation, so by subdividing fields you are reducing the arable or livestock area. You end up eliminating the local, traditional culture and you generate pressure in the territory, inflation in nearby land, because there is an excess demand for acquiring land in Patagonia&rdquo; (diario financiero, 2022)</span></i></p>

<img src= "/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/0.5%20Land%20Subdivision_Urbanization%20of%20the%20Rural.jpg">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021 alone, a significant number of applications were received to create new land subdivision projects in Chiloe. A relevant share of these subdivision projects is to sell plots of 5,000 m2, the minimum subdivision area for agricultural land allowed by law in rural areas. Near the more urban areas of the Island, the buyers are local middle-class people looking to build their first homes there. But in the more rural areas near rivers and bays, large pieces of land are being bought by real estate investors from outside the region. Investors have subdivided plots and sold them for a second -or third- home or as an investment to foreigner sellers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to people in the area, between 2014 and 2020, the surplus value of land in the region rose ten times. If the hectare used to be sold for between $2 million and $3 million pesos, it could cost now $40 million peso. For the same reason, the local community and farmers-despite the warnings and problems this brings to Chiloe they have- began to sell.</span></p>

<p><strong>Because of the bad practices in the use of this regulation and the granting of permits for the construction of single-family condominiums in rural areas, today we are facing the loss of land rich in natural and agricultural resources, with an irreversible environmental impact, such as the dismemberment of the ecological mosaic, fragmentation of biodiversity corridors and overload of municipal services, without internalizing the social and environmental costs of hidden suburbanization.</strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unbalances Urbanization Process-Study Case Parcelaci&oacute;n R&iacute;o Vilc&uacute;n</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Parcelacion R&iacute;o Vilc&uacute;n Chilo&eacute; is located on a 57-hectare Rustic Property that in its first stage lots 45 exclusive parcels whose variety includes: meadows, saplings, river banks and panoramic views, of a minimum of 5,000 m2 surrounded by an environment full of tranquility and nature. The project is being promoted to foreigner buyers from other regions of the country as &ldquo;the best investment for your future&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By analyzing the project, there is no clear urbanization plan with the possibility of generating new settlements. Many sites do not have access to roads, do not have water, and even less are urbanized with electricity or clean sanitation. The new housing poles in natural landscapes are located in areas that "are not prepared for this type of densification," says the NGO Center for the Study and Conservation of Natural Heritage (CECPAN) statement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The generation of these new housing poles in unplanned areas causes territorial segregation and the demand for local governments to provide essential services they can't offer. Hidden suburbanization in Chiloe is creating an irreparable modification of the rural landscape , altering these territories' cultural identity and agricultural vocation. The island of Chiloe is facing devastating consequences such as "an important loss of native forest, due to land clearing; the destruction of valuable ecosystems, as well as the affectation of species of special value or vulnerability."&nbsp; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(diario financiero, 2022)</span></i></p>

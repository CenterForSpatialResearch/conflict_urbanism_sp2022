![Amazon Facilities in California](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_California_Facilities_Intro-01.png)
The state of California boasts the highest number of Amazon facilities across the US—and that number is continually growing. The COVID-19 pandemic and related stay-at-home orders have increased the demand within the online marketplace, contributing to an exponential growth of Amazon’s distribution networks in just the last few years. 

These facilities are heavily entangled in the state’s economic structure, playing large roles in its employment rate, subsidies, sales taxes, and so on. Of these, sales taxes—more specifically, the Bradley-Burns 1% Local Sales and Use Tax—have been a subject of increasing contention between the cities who host Amazon Fulfillment Centers and cities who do not.


#### California Sales Taxes and Jurisdictions: Bradley-Burns 1% Local Sales and Use Tax

![California sales tax breakdown diagram](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_Bradley-Burns_General-01.png)
Every city in the state of California is subjected to a statewide sales tax rate of 7.25% plus the local tax that is added at the county level, the city level, or both. For example, a consumer buying pizza at a Whole Foods store in Upland, CA, a city in San Bernardino county, is charged a total of 7.75% in sales tax, 7.25% of which is mandated by the state, and 0.5% of which is mandated by the county. Not all of the 7.25% sales tax goes to the state, however. The Bradley-Burns 1% Local Sales and Use Tax (henceforth referred to as the Bradley-Burns tax) is a statewide tax whose revenues are actually under the local jurisdiction: either the city or the county of where the sale occurs (“place of sale”). 

The Bradley-Burns tax is divided into two categories, depending on whether the retailer is considered in-state or out-of-state. If the retailer is considered “in-state” under California law, the tax is considered a sales tax, and its jurisdiction belongs to the city in which the sale occurred (e.g. you go to a local bakery, and the 1% of the tax collected for the pastries you purchased is considered sales tax, and it will belong to the city). However, if the retailer is considered “out-of-state,” the tax is actually considered a use tax, and the taxes that are collected in each city within the county are pooled together at the county level, and reallocated among all of the cities in that county—whether they had any use tax revenues or not. 


![Bradley-Burns out-of-state retailer use tax flow](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_Tax_Diagram_Out-of-State.png)
One of the biggest sources of the out-of-state use tax was—to no one’s surprise—Amazon. Prior to 2021, if you made a purchase on Amazon in the city of Rancho Cucamonga, CA, the item that you purchased would come from the fulfillment center in the nearby city, Rialto. Because Amazon was considered out-of-state at the time due to the fulfillment centers being run by an out-of-state third party company, the 1% of the tax you paid at the time of your purchase (alongside that of your neighbors in nearby cities in the county) would be pooled at the county level—San Bernardino—where the “place of sale” belongs, and redistributed back to the cities. 

![Bradley-Burns in-state retailer sales tax flow](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_Tax_Diagram_In-State.png)
But in 2021, Amazon restructured its ownership, whereby the fulfillment centers, which had been operated by a third-party company, were now run by the company itself. This made Amazon an “in-state” retailer under California law, which meant that the 1% tax collected is now considered a sales tax, which is collected exclusively at the city level—in this case, Rialto. This is because California law considers the point at which deliveries are sent (the fulfillment center) as the “place of sale.” 

![Bradley-Burns tax change after Amazon restructuring](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_Tax_Diagram_Before-and-After-01.png)
This did not matter much when Amazon was considered an out-of-state retailer because no matter where in the county the fulfillment centers were located, the jurisdiction over the use tax belonged to the county. However, with Amazon’s switch to an in-state retailer, what was use tax was now considered sales tax, and it belonged to the city—not the county—where the fulfillment centers were located. 

![Cal-Cities Online Sales Tax Equity Conflict](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_Argument_Diagram-01.png)
Unsurprisingly, this pitted the cities against each other, dividing the cities into two groups: the consumer cities and the host cities. The city of Rancho Cucamonga—a consumer city—proposed a resolution to the League of California Cities (henceforth Cal Cities) that would support a legislation that would enable the sales tax proceeds be distributed to the cities where the goods were delivered to, instead of being distributed to the cities where the goods were delivered from, arguing that the current tax system unfairly favors the host cities. Against this proposal, the host cities argued that they are the ones that carry the environmental burden of hosting the fulfillment centers, and that the proposal is racist—according to one Fresno city leader—because fulfillment centers are mostly located in disadvantaged communities of color, and that the proposal heavily favors cities with communities that are wealthier and are able to spend more, and generate greater amount of sales tax revenues. 

#### Inter-City Conflicts: County of San Bernardino
![San Bernardino County Host and Consumer Cities](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_SanBernardinoMaps-01.png)
Taking a closer look at San Bernardino County—which has a substantial number of fulfillment centers in close proximity to one another—can help answer some of these questions. Although the mere presence of a fulfillment center cannot indicate causation, the question that this investigation asks is one about equity: are host cities more disadvantaged than non-host cities in terms of environmental hazard and socioeconomic status – and how are these discrepancies distributed among historically disadvantaged racial groups? More specifically, do host cities, and their residents, experience greater levels of pollution and poverty, and do these cities house a higher percentage of people of color?

![San Bernardino County Pollution Burden](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_SanBernardinoMaps-04.png)
When a new Amazon facility is opened, its impact expands beyond the physical structure of the fulfillment center. Not only do nodes along the Amazon delivery network conjure a substantial influx of semi trucks and delivery vans–which spew noxious pollutants into the air– they also prompt an influx of commuter traffic. Given that fulfillment centers are placed within industrial areas, even local commuters are often required to drive to their place of work. Increases in traffic results in more treacherous roads for commuters and drivers alike, and nearby residents but deal with the consequences of diminished road safety, increased noise pollution and worsened air quality. 

Diesel particulate matter (PM) is one hazard expelled from the exhaust of transportation vehicles and industrial equipment with diesel engines. Diesel PM can be incredibly harmful to individuals and is associated with a number of health complications including heart disease, lung disease, and cancer. (SOURCE). The map above indicates that on average, host cities in San Bernardino County do experience elevated levels of Diesel PM relative to their adjacent non-host counterparts. It is worth noting that generally, the region as a whole has some of the worst air quality in the country. (SOURCE) Looking more broadly across an aggregate of pollution indicators, host cities once again edge out adjacent non-host cities with regards to their average pollution burden percentile.   

![San Bernardino County Poverty Population](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_SanBernardinoMaps-03.png)
Amazon tends to locate its fulfillment centers in markedly poor areas. (SOURCE) On one hand, residents in these areas are perhaps greatly in need of stable work – but this comes at the expense of the pollution impacts highlighted above. Poorer communities, generally, are more at-risk for negative health outcomes. Additionally, they are afforded less social mobility, as individuals at or below the poverty line are greatly restricted in their ability to select an ideal living scenario. Also of note, communities with the most Amazon warehouses nearby have the lowest rates of Amazon sales per household – meaning they face the most direct environmental repercussions of the fulfillment centers with mimized benefit. (SOURCE) In the southwest region of San Bernardino County, the number of people living below two-times the federal poverty level is notably higher in host cities, when compared to non-host cities in the region.  

![San Bernardino County POC](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_SanBernardinoMaps-05.png)
The majority of Amazon’s fulfillment centers are built in areas that are largely populated by people of color. Almost 70% of warehouses are located in neighborhoods with a higher-than-typical proportion of people of color. (SOURCE) Thus, the environmental damage that Amazon fulfillment centers cause disproportionately affects non-white Californians. Host cities in Southwest San Bernardino County generally have more residents of color than the nonhost cities that surround them. It appears that host cities are indeed facing an unequal distribution of negative externalities as a result of the expanding amazon distribution network, but that doesn’t mean the non-host cities are completely unaffected by the negative externalities of the Amazon distribution network.


#### Intra-City Conflicts: City of Fresno, CA
For over a decade, states, counties, and cities have offered subsidies to Amazon in exchange for the opportunity to host a part of the e-commerce giant’s distribution network. With the company’s 2021 restructuring and subsequent changes in sales tax distribution, cities have an ever greater stake in hosting fulfillment centers in particular. This also means that—as the company chooses where to locate their facilities—Amazon now has even greater power in shaping the economic well-being of California’s cities.

Although the deals struck between Amazon and city governments have been shrouded in greater amounts of secrecy in the last few years, it is evident that Fresno, CA has given a staggering amount of subsidies to the company. While some counties or groups of cities have given Amazon between one and two million dollars in subsidies, the city of Fresno granted Amazon $30 million worth of subsidies in the form of tax rebates and a 90% property tax discount in exchange for hosting the city’s first Amazon fulfillment center. Now, the city is facing resident pushback for planning to add yet another facility. 

Part of the issue is a zoning problem: the city’s General Plan has designated thousands of acres in South Fresno as an industrial zone, despite a history of residential neighborhoods in the area. The current fulfillment center, as well as the planned facility, fall within this heavy industrial zone, next to houses and schools.  

![Fresno_Zoning](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/WSH_Fresno_Mappings-01.png)
Fresno’s industrial plan led residents—namely, the South Fresno Community Alliance—to seek legal action. In 2021, the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability (LCJA) represented the alliance and filed a petition to challenge Fresno’s approval of the Program Environmental Impact Report that allowed for the industrial zone designation. As of early 2022, the city and the LCJA negotiated a settlement agreement: per the agreement, the warehouse developer must contribute $300,000 to a community benefit fund that helps residents make improvements to their homes to offset the light, noise, and pollution created by the project. 

What, then, are the conditions that are linked to this heavy industrial zone?

Here, the residents’ case against Amazon and Fresno’s General Plan appears to have great validity. South Fresno suffers from a disproportionate amount of diesel particulate matter and pollution overall.

When one considers that these polluted zones overlap with areas that house a higher percentage of children, the effects of such pollution become even more serious. These polluted industrial zones also overlap with communities of color, showing that race and political inequity go hand in hand.

A main argument for cities who are looking to host Amazon facilities is that these warehouses bring a good number of jobs into the area. This begs the question: are the workers employed in these facilities even residents of the host cities? When examining Fresno’s unemployment rate over time, it becomes clear that the city’s unemployment rate remains high above the state average, and has not significantly decreased that gap. Moreover, the communities of South Fresno—the most disenfranchised neighborhoods who bear the brunt of the industrial zone’s effects—continue to have a higher unemployment rate than the whiter, more northern parts of the city.

#### Conclusion (in-progress)
The resolution put forth by the city of Rancho Cucamonga and the subcommittee for the Online Sales Tax Equity was reviewed by the General Committee of Cal-Cities and was returned to the subcommittee for further investigation—and it is an ongoing issue. However, it does seem clear that at every scale—of the city and the county scales—Amazon is in the end the entity that comes on top. In order to mitigate the issues presented by both the host cities and the consumer cities in California, it does seem that the cities need to move on from an intra/inter-city conflict, to a conflict between the cities of California and Amazon.

#### Proposal  


We will be exploring and documenting the landscape of advertising in New York City’s subway lines and stations. Our process will begin with the selection of several subway lines that will form the scope of the project. Lines will be chosen to cover neighborhoods with a variety of socioeconomic characteristics. We will then create an inventory of advertising in the stations and on the trains themselves along each of these lines, aiming to categorize each ad in several ways (e. g. the type of product or service being promoted, the condition of the ad, and whether it is physical or digital). Finally, we will map our dataset and document the patterns that emerge. Since advertisements are updated relatively frequently, our hope is that our data will provide a snapshot in time of the advertising riders may encounter.

Subway ads are ubiquitous, and they are viewed countless times every day by over a million people across the city. We are interested in examining the content and context of these ads through the lens of infrastructure and infrapolitics. Brian Larkin (2013) invites a discussion of media as infrastructure in the digital age, in which “production has been outsourced, value is produced virtually, infrastructures lie in computer products,” and “the regulation of attention is central to the production of value” (339). Larkin notes the sensory and aesthetic dimensions of infrastructure alongside its practical functions, and visual advertising . Advertising on subways relates to Larkin’s conception of infrastructure in another way: it is the interaction between two infrastructural systems: the physical machinery of the transportation network that carries people across the city, and the informational network of products, services, and ideas constantly being broadcast in train cars and stations.

Our primary anticipated outcomes for our final project are creating our own dataset and subsequent spatial visualization of subway advertising along two (or more) subway lines in New York City. Through observational fieldwork, we aim to categorize the types of subway advertising we see by the types of company/organization sponsoring the advertising, what the content of the ads are, and what medium is being used to display the advertisements (e.g. digital or poster). Moreover, we are also interested in examining what types of ads tend to be shown in the subway car as opposed to in the subway station (from general anecdotal evidence, it seems that advertisements surrounding television/broadway shows and movies tend to be shown in the subway station vs the subway car).

In documenting these advertising typologies, we hope to identify larger patterns regarding the relationship between subway advertising and underlying socioeconomic characteristics by neighborhood. For example, perhaps subway stations with high ridership counts and located in higher income neighborhoods tend to have more digital advertising by startup companies. Further research outside of our observational fieldwork approach might involve looking into how much these subway ads cost, quantifying the monetary lengths that companies go to in order to display subway advertising to commuters.

Datasets that we are considering to use in the final project include MTA subway ridership data, ACS Census Bureau estimates for neighborhood demographic data, and an NYC gentrification index by Harvard Dataverse. Most importantly, we will be creating a dataset of our own through this project which will function as a snapshot of subway advertising for selected subway lines in NYC during a specific time period.

We will use a Borough Boundaries shapefile and the Subway Lines shapefile in order to create our basemap of New York City and our train lines (7, L, R). We will have a separate map that consists of our basemap with the TIGER shapefile, on this map we will add the NYC Gentrification Index and join them through census tract numbers.



#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.

See this is now a new paragraph.

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/sample_image.png)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="http://levichm.github.io/Conflict_R_Line" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

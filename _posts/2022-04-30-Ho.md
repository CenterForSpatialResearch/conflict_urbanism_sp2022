> “...production has been outsourced, value is produced virtually, infrastructures lie in computer protocols, and the forms of capture engineered into social media platforms, such as facebook and google. In this economy the regulation of attention is central to the production value” (Larkin, 2013, p. 339).

#### Infrastructure, Infrapolitics, and the Subway  

In *The Politics and Poetics of Infrastructure*, Brian Larkin invites a discussion of media as infrastructure in the digital age. A single definition that encircles everything we think of as *infrastructure* is elusive. It is at first the system of “...built networks that facilitate the flow of goods, people, or ideas and allow for exchange over space” (p. 328). Infrastructure also takes on more abstract qualities. From technical and physical systems to the, in Larkin’s words, “fetish-like” aspects and forms of desire and fantasy imbued in them, infrastructure makes up a significant portion of the structures we encounter and inhabit in modern daily life. 

Within New York City’s subway system, the rider is a captive audience to a stream of communications competing for their valuable attention. As the subway’s physical infrastructure facilitates the movement of people and their goods around the city, its informational infrastructure delivers messages from institutional, state, and corporate actors directly to the rider through posters and an increasing number of digital displays.

James C. Scott coined the term *infrapolitics* to describe informal networks of communication and resistance, often carried out anonymously (2012, p. 1). The subways are a site of historical conflict between formalized communications and their informal, infrapolitical counterparts. Most advertising on the subway is state-sanctioned–a blend of public notices and corporate messages. New York City subway ads in particular are infamous for provocation, testing the boundaries of what is socially acceptable. In content, medium, and style, they reflect their time and place, and the attitudes of the society by which they are sanctioned and curated. Forms of non-sanctioned, infrapolitical communication on the subway have become more anonymous and uncommon since the heyday of graffiti and “subway writing” in the 1970s and early 1980s. The Giuliani administration waged a war on graffiti as part of its broken-windows policing tactics. Graffiti and other forms of resistance and subversion are more subtle than ever, and most of what the rider sees is carefully curated by the state. 

#### Project Goals  

We set out to explore and document what riders of the R train encounter throughout the cars and stations of the line. The R train travels through three boroughs representing a diverse transect of New York City, including demographically distinct neighborhoods from Flushing to Midtown to Bay Ridge. Since advertisements are updated relatively frequently, our data represents a snapshot in time, with data collection having occurred during late winter of 2022. Our exploration resulted in the creation of a dataset and a collection of photos, which we later examined in detail. 

In documenting these advertising typologies, we hope to identify larger patterns regarding the relationship between subway advertising and underlying socioeconomic characteristics by neighborhood. For example, perhaps subway stations with high ridership counts and located in higher income neighborhoods tend to have more digital advertising by startup companies. Further research outside of our observational fieldwork approach might involve looking into how much these subway ads cost, quantifying the monetary lengths that companies go to in order to display subway advertising to commuters. 

The subway cars themselves travel along the entire length of the R line, and people can be expected to spend more time in the train car than the (localized) environment of the station platform. Advertisers choose their target demographics carefully. Can we find trends in what is being communicated to whom, and where? What are the irregularities, informal ads, vandalism, and infrapolitical communications? Are they forms of resistance?
